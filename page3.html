      <h2>My Casual Style</h2>
      <p>
        Casual fashion is all about comfort, confidence, and simplicity.
        My casual look usually combines relaxed pieces like hoodies, tees,
        jeans, and sneakers—all items that make it easy to move around while
        still looking put together.
      </p>
      <p>
        What makes casual outfits fun is how flexible they are. You can
        dress them up with accessories or layer them depending on the
        season. This page shows my go-to casual style and how I put
        outfits together for everyday life.

        Here's a simple example of what I might wear on a typical day:
        comfortable joggers, a clean tee, and my favorite sneakers.
