      <h2>Relaxed Style for the Weekend</h2>
      <p>
        Weekend Wear is all about staying comfortable while still looking sharp.
        Whether you're hanging out with friends, running errands, or exploring
        the city, this style focuses on relaxed pieces that feel good and look
        clean.
      </p>
      <p>
        Soft tops, relaxed-fit jeans, joggers, and stylish sneakers are the core
        of a great weekend outfit. You can layer with jackets, hoodies, or
        sweaters depending on the weather to keep the look functional and
        effortless.
