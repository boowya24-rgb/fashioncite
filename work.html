      <h2>What Defines High-End Fashion?</h2>
      <p>
        High-end fashion is all about premium materials, tailored silhouettes,
        and designs that make a statement. These pieces are typically crafted
        by luxury brands and designers who prioritize craftsmanship, quality,
        and exclusivity over mass production.
      </p>
      <p>
        From structured coats and handcrafted leather shoes to luxury watches
        and iconic handbags, high-end fashion pieces elevate a wardrobe by
        adding timeless elegance and sophistication. This style is often seen
        on runways, celebrities, and formal events where presentation matters.
